### MySQL
- Allows users to create a database connection with the defined .sql file.

### Starting the program with the .jar
- To run, fork and reach the main source path and run the command:
- `java -jar RPMS.jar <username> <password>`
- where <username> and <password> are the designated fields for the MySQL connection

### Challenges I ran into
- This was meant to be a group project but I took the workload on myself. It was tedious but worth while.
- The search filter system could be improved with some sort of strategy interface design pattern.
- Determining how to insert a jpg into a JTable when viewing properties.
